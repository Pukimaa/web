# Other

# Spotify Covers

I recently made quite a few Spotify Covers for friends and myself. But I’m excited to create more!

# Cocktail Showcase

Just two pages of information of cocktails that were offered at an event.

# Calypso Banner

This was part of a contest. I got third place!

The planets are inspired by Kurzgesagt and the whole banner was made in Figma.

I first used an image and blurred it a lot to create that cool gradient. I also applied a small vignette to make the main part pop a bit more.

The plannets are esentially just a bunch of fully rounded rectangles in different colors.

I also came up with using the logo of Calypso as the “o” and putting the link to the server in the whitespace of the Wordmark.

# Solis

Solis is a color palette created by a friend of mine. I went ahead and made a logo as well as some wallpapers using the Solis color scheme.
